<h3 align="center">A Systems Development student from Brazil.</h3>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **the basics of programming from free online sources such as The Odin Project, freeCodeCamp, CS50 and also resources in Portuguese from Curso em VÃ­deo (seriously recommend them if you know the language).**

- ðŸ”­ What you'll find here for now: **as I'm an absolute newbie, not many interesting and revolutionary projects will be available -for now-. I'll be focusing on repos containing activities and projects from my studies.**
